## Introduction

Whether it’s an office, clinic, school or the residence, electricity is an essential utility. Unlike developed countries, access to clean, reliable and safe power in the global south can be difficult and in many cases expensive. 

Access to a reliable power supplies is essential to humanitarian programming. Power is needed for lighting, cold chain, heating, communications and to run IT systems. The provisioning of safe power is also very challenging as materials in some places will be of poor quality. Lack of skills can lead to poorly installed systems which pose a serious risk to equipment and people. 

This guide has been written to improve the knowledge people managing humanitarian programmes about electricity supplies. Whilst it contains a lot of best practice advice and tips, this guide is not intended to be a detailed electrical installation guide. Electrical installations should always be carried out by qualified electricians who have demonstrable skills. 

Whilst it’s very unlikely that the high standards required under law (IEE for the UK) will be reached, aid organisations have a responsibility to all of its team to provide a safe working environment. This guide illustrates electrical best practices.

This guide also includes some planning tools to help you estimate energy needs for any site. Good planning will enable you to select the correct size generator or solar system for the site. 

The first edition of this guide was created by Mark Hawkins for Merlin in 2012. It has now been shared freely with the Nethope community to help all members to create a safe working environment for Aid Workers and beneficiaries. I hope that in the near version, that this guide will be replaced with a more up to date version incorporating more information about renewable energy.

## Safety
This chapter highlights some of the risk experienced in NGO sites every day. Whilst there are a few extreme examples of bad practice or poor design mentioned, the majority of the problems illustrated have been collected from a wide range of sites over the past fifteen years.
### Electricity Kills!
In the aid sector, the provision of a safe and efficient electrical system is not treated as a priority. As a result, severe risk of electrocution will exist in the office, the bathroom and the bedroom. There have been reports from the field where team members have received electric shocks whilst operating equipment. In one severe case, an aid work was killed in one agency when a team member was electrocuted in a bathroom

Here are some examples of defects which are presenting danger to people;
